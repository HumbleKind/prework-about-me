      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>From teaching myself to code sites from scratch at the dawn of the web in the early 90s, to the unsuccessful launch of a tech startup I founded almost a decade ago, I'm finally comming full circle! Along the way, I earned a degree in Biochemistry, and a Masters of Architecture.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Portland OR</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a triathlete, who enjoys the great outdoors!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ideally, I'd be hired as a Technical PM or Dev Manager, at a local tech startup.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>My family lives in Portland.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I would love to start my own business (again - successfully!), after having developed/ coded the entire UI/UX myself!</p>
